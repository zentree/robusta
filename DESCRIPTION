Description: This package implements Robust Selection as described by
Evison D.C. and Apiolaza L.A. 2015. Incorporating economic weights into 
Radiata pine breeding selection decisions. Canadian Journal of Forest 
Research 45(1): 135-140 DOI: 10.1139/cjfr-2014-036.
    We combined genetic parameters, relative economic weights (and the
uncertainties surrounding those weights) to find genotypes that both
have high economic value and always perform above average.
